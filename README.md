# 🤖 Machine Learning Class Projects
Welcome to my Machine Learning class projects repository! This repository contains my implementations and analyses of various machine learning models covered in the course.

## 📚 Models Covered
1. k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) Classification
2. Linear Regression
3. Logistic Regression with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
4. Neural Networks Classification

Each model's implementation and results can be found in its respective Jupyter Notebook.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To explore any of the projects, simply navigate to the corresponding file. Because it is a Jupyter Notebook file, you can already see its output.

## 📝 Note
Please note that these projects were completed as part of my Machine Learning class, and I have used various datasets and techniques to analyze and build the models. The results and conclusions are based on the specific datasets and methods used.

Feel free to explore the projects, and I hope you find them informative and insightful!

## 🙌 Acknowledgments
Special thanks to my instructor and the course for providing valuable insights and guidance throughout the projects.
